## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle Length and ground clearance provided non-random amount of variance ot the mpg values. 

Slope is not zero, because there are non zero values as coefficients. 

Yes, the Rsquared value suggests that about 70% of the time are predictions will be correct when using this model

The summary statisitics aboce suggest that when overall the variance in the suspension coils is less than the 100 PSI cut point. However, when stratified by lot there is large difference in the variance among Lots, with Lot 3 having the highest variance.
